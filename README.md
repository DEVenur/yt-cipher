Basic service to eval yt player scripts for nsig stuff. 

## Getting Started

The easiest way to use this right now is with docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kikkia/yt-cipher.git

cd yt-cipher

docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## ðŸ”’ Authentication

You'll need to set the `API_BEARER_TOKEN` environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Requests without a valid `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>` header will be rejected.
